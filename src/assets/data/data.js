Her work there helped reshape the country’s healthcare structure through the “Affordable Care Act.”",

Infuriated with the struggle of these entrepreneurs in the burgeoning cannabis industry, Anne decided to help them against this unfair treatment and to help these start-up businesses understand and comply with the complex matrix of laws, rules, policies, and reporting required to remain legal.",

Currently, her practice focuses on regulatory compliance, expansion, and exit strategies for domestic and transnational cannabis, CBD, and hemp companies. She provides legal counsel to national and international non-cannabis businesses seeking entry into the cannabis space. She is writing a much-anticipated memoir on the early days of legal cannabis, which will be published before the end of 2021."

Upon release, he had nothing but a project he had put together while incarcerated.",
